        PUBG has a classic battle royale set-up. 100 players are dropped onto an island in teams of four,
         and have to scavenge resources and eliminate the competition until they're the last ones standing.
          As the game progresses, the 'safe' area become smaller, making it increasingly difficult for remaining players to survive.
This type of game has become so popular because it forces you to think and act quickly, so it's very engaging. 
Every single decision you make can have a massive impact on your chances of survival and the outcome of the game.
